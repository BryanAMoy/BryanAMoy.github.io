  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p> Hi, my full name is Bryan Andrew Moy and I am currently a first year (freshman) student enrolled in University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
      My hobbies consist of playing basketball recreationally and competitively.  I am an avid gamer like the average teenage guy.
      My current interest and accepted major is computer engineering.  I gained inspiration for my passion for computer engineering from Steve Jobs, Apple,
      and Google.  Those are my and probably everyones' dream job.  Technology is the future and I thought it may be one of the most influential careers in the future.
      Interesting fact is that I am an employee of one of the trendiest stores/restaurant called 10 Below Ice Cream.
      Some back story about me is that I am a chess champion in '08 and came in 19th place in the nation from 900 rating and below.
