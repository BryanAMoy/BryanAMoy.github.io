  <img src="propic.jpg"
    alt="Me" style="width: 250px; height:250px;">
  <p style="color:black;"> Hi, my name is Bryan Moy and I am currently a third year Computer Engineering student enrolled in University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
      My hobbies consist of playing basketball recreationally and competitively.  I am an avid gamer like the average teenage guy.
      Languages I've learned and am learning are C++, C, Java, Python, MIPS, ARM, Verilog, and HTML.
      My passion for computer engineering came from Steve Jobs, Apple,
      and Google.  Those are my and probably everyones' elses dream job.  Technology is the future and I thought it may be one of the most influential careers in the future.
      Interesting fact is that I am an employee of one of the trendiest stores/restaurant called 10 Below Ice Cream.
      Some back story about me is that I am a chess champion in 2008 and came in 19th place in the nation from 900 rating and below.
      I am currently learning C and Python, but looking forward to expanding my coding experience with JavaScript.  I hope to work for a game company
      or for a trendy website like buzzfeed or facebook.
  </p>
  <h7 style="color:black; font-size:180%;">Where I'm From</h7>
  <p style="color:black;">
    I'm from one of the most special places in the world, New York City.  Being born and raised in a rough, tough, and rude city helped become a person of my own. This city teaches you to stand up for yourself and
    strive for the best because it is such a competitive place.  With over 8 million people in the city you are bound to see something new everyday and meet someone new everyday.

  </p>
  <h4 style="color:black; font-size:180%;">Volunteering Experience and Community Involvement</h4>
  <p style="color:black;"> All my life since I was very young I have always volunteered and got involved in my community whether its cleaning the streets, serving food at the soup kitchen, etc.
      Mostly, my volunteering career has been with Asian American Youth Center (AAYC).  This non-profit organization is a huge part of my life because my father is co-founder and current
      president of the community service organization.  In addition, a lot of my closest and current friends that I will probably be in contact till the end of life volunteer for this organization.
      I was taught that one of the most important aspect of a society to be successful and survive is to help each other and give back.  It taught me to be nicer to people of all colors and status and that
      everyone is the same.  A benefit of volunteering is networking because you never who you meet and can help you in return.  I've met so many great people through volunteering and it is something everyone needs to do
      if you want to be successful in any career, and besides, you help the less fortunate.
  </p>
  <h5 style="color:black; font-size:180%;">Hobbies</h5>
  <p style="color:black;">My hobbies have been consistent throughout my life.  I have always been playing sports and involved in competitive activities.  The main sport I have always been playing is
    basketball.  However, in my early childhood that was not the case. I liked to play baseball mainly with the occassional games of football.  In my hobbies my passion for competitiveness and wanting to be the best
    in whatever activity is what drives me to become a bigger and better person.  Although it is part of my studies, I am currently trying to make coding a hobby of mine because to be successful in something you need to
    put time and effort to be good at it.  I make random projects and small programs for fun to learn and expand my coding language.
