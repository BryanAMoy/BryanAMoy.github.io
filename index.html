  <h3 style="color:white; font-size:180%;">Bio</h3>
  <p style="color:white;"> Hi, my full name is Bryan Andrew Moy and I am currently a first year (freshman) student enrolled in University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
      My hobbies consist of playing basketball recreationally and competitively.  I am an avid gamer like the average teenage guy.
      My current interest and accepted major is computer engineering.  I gained inspiration for my passion for computer engineering from Steve Jobs, Apple,
      and Google.  Those are my and probably everyones' dream job.  Technology is the future and I thought it may be one of the most influential careers in the future.
      Interesting fact is that I am an employee of one of the trendiest stores/restaurant called 10 Below Ice Cream.
      Some back story about me is that I am a chess champion in '08 and came in 19th place in the nation from 900 rating and below.
  </p>
  <h4 style="color:red; font-size:180%;">Volunteering Experience and Community Involvement</h4>
  <p style="color:red;"> All my life since I was very young I have always volunteered and got involved in my community whether its cleaning the streets, serving food at the soup kitchen, etc.
      Mostly, my volunteering career has been with Asian American Youth Center (AAYC).  This non-profit organization is a huge part of my life because my father is co-founder and current
      president of the community service organization.  In addition, a lot of my closest and current friends that I will probably be in contact till the end of life volunteer for this organization.
  </p>   
  <h5 style="color:yellow; font-size:180%;">Hobbies</h5>
  <p style="color:yellow;">My hobbies have been consistent throughout my life.  I have always been playing sports and involved in competitive activities.  The main sport I have always been playing is 
    basketball.  However, in my early childhood that was not the case. I liked to play baseball mainly with the occassional games of football.  In my hobbies my passion for competitiveness and wanting to be the best
    in whatever activity is what drives me to become a bigger and better person.
